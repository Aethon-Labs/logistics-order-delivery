# Logistics and Items Delivery Traffic Prediction using AI

## Overview
This project aims to build a solution for predicting the delivery traffic in a logistics and items delivery system using AI, MQTT, and cloud technologies. The solution will collect data about the vehicles used for delivery, such as the vehicle's make, model, location, delivery route, delivery speed, delivery history, and weather conditions. The collected data will be stored in an object storage service, preprocessed, and used to train a machine learning model to predict the delivery traffic. The trained model will be deployed in the cloud as an API and the results of the traffic prediction will be stored in a database.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- MQTT
- Cloud object storage (e.g. Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage)
- Machine learning libraries (e.g. scikit-learn or TensorFlow)
- Web framework (e.g. Flask or Django)
- Database (e.g. MySQL or PostgreSQL)

## Data Collection
The data about the vehicles used for delivery will be collected from IoT devices such as GPS trackers and sensors installed on the vehicles, as well as from weather APIs. The data will be transmitted to the cloud through MQTT, a real-time messaging protocol for IoT devices.

## Data Storage
The collected data will be stored in an object storage service, such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage, for easy access and retrieval.

## Data Preprocessing
The collected data will be preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and to convert categorical variables into numerical variables. The preprocessed data will then be divided into training and test sets for model evaluation.

## Model Training
The preprocessed data will be used to train a machine learning model, such as a random forest, gradient boosting, or a neural network, to predict the delivery traffic. The model will be trained using Python libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

## Model Evaluation
The trained machine learning model will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model with the best evaluation metrics will be selected for deployment.

## Model Deployment
The selected machine learning model will be deployed in the cloud using a web framework, such as Flask or Django, to provide an API for prediction. The API will be accessed by the logistics company to retrieve the delivery traffic predictions.

## Database
A database, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, will be used to store the processed data and the results of the traffic prediction analysis. The database will be accessed by the cloud solution to retrieve the data for analysis and prediction.
